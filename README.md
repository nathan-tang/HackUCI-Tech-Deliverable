### How was building it:
```
This was my first project in React.js and also my first time experiementing with 
HTML Requests. As a result, it is a little bit sloppier than how I would like it to be.
Nonetheless, I understand that this is a learning process.

Thus, I hope to be able to participate in more HackUCI events in the future to better 
develop my programming abilities. It was actually ZotHacks 2019 that first introduced 
me to web development and ever since then I have been experiementing whenever I had time.

This deliverable had me experiment with a lot of things I was not previously comfortable 
with. For example: 

    React.js, Axios (HTML Requests), and CSS Media Queries.

All of which are essential to proper web design. So I am actually grateful for this
opportunity as it allowed me to grow and exit my comfort zone! Thank you!

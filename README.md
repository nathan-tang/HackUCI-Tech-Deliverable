### How was building it:
```
This was my first project in React.js and also my first time experiementing with 
HTML Requests. As a result, it is a little bit sloppier than how I would like it to be.
Nonetheless, I understand that this is a learning process.

Thus, I hope to be able to participate in more HackUCI events in the future to better 
develop my programming abilities. It was actually ZotHacks 2019 that first introduced 
me to web development and ever since then I have been experiementing whenever I had time.

This deliverable had me experiment with a lot of things I was not previously comfortable 
with. For example: 

    React.js, Axios (HTML Requests), and CSS Media Queries.

All of which are essential to proper web design. So I am actually grateful for this
opportunity as it allowed me to grow and exit my comfort zone! Thank you!

## Voyager Expansion:
```
I named it Voyager Expansion because of the NASA 1977 Voyager program where two robotic
probes were sent out to explore the furthest reaches of our solar system and beyond.
I feel like that is the essense of hackthons - the ambition and the curiousity to 
explore the limits of our own abilities and go further beyond.

That, and I thought it would sound cool.
